Unless mentioned otherwise, for CIFAR we follow the
image preprocessing of [8] with ZCA whitening. However, for some CIFAR experiments
we instead use simple mean/std normalization such that we can directly comp

CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets [17] consist of 32 × 32 color
images drawn from 10 and 100 classes split into 50,000 train and 10,000 test images. For data
augmentation we do horizontal flips and take random crops from image padded by 4 pixels on
each side, filling missing pixels with reflections of original image.
