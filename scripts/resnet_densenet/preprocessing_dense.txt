DenseNet

--> augmentations:

the images are
first zero-padded with 4 pixels on each side, then randomly
cropped to again produce 32×32 images; half of the images
are then horizontally mirrored

-> Zero padded
-> Mirrored

--> Preprocessing:

For data preprocessing, we normalize the data
using the channel means and standard deviations.

Channel means and STDs like for WideNet
